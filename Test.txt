1.Expalin java and javac?
java is to run the program
javac is a command which is to convert source code to byte code

2.Explain JDK,JRE,JVM?
JVM - Java Virtual Machine
JVM is not physically exist 
Components
1.Verifies the code
2.Interpreter the code
3.Execute the code

JRE : Java Runtime Environment
JRE is a combination of JVM + set of libraties 
JRE is physically exist
JRE is provide runtime environment

JDK : Java Development Kit
JDK is combination of JRE & development kit like java documents
JDK is physically exist

3.List the limitations of array?
1.It is having fixed size
2.When declaring array in that time we give size of the compulsory.


4.Explain class,object and signature of the class
Class : class is a template or blueprint or design which contains states and behaviour
States is variable
Ex: Class Pen{
    String penName;
     int price;
    }
Behaviour is method
Ex: Class Pen - toWrite()

Object : Object is a instance of a class.
instance is a realtime
instance means we can feel,touch,see

Uses:
We can create a multiple copies of the class

* Instance variable can create a object

Signature of class :
ClassName referenceVariable = new ClassName();
Ex: Pen pen = new Pen();


5.Difference between .java file and .class file?
.java file is to save the file 
.class file is to run the program

6.Explain method signature

public static void methodName(parameter)

Access modifiers like puublic, private, protected
public : it is to access any class
private is to access within the class
protected means acess within the packages

returntype - void means we cannot return any values

7.What is Java?
Java is high level object oriented programming language

8.List the java IDE's
1.IntelliJ IDEA community edition
2.eclipse
3.notepad++

9.What is variable? Expalin it's types?
Variable is a used to stored the data in the memory

types of variables 
1.Local variable
2.Static Variable
3.Instance Variable

1.Local variable : means we can declare and initialize the variable inside the method.
* decalration and initialization is important
Class Person{
public static void main(String a[]){
       String name = "XYZ";
       int age = 29;
       String gender = "Female";
}
 
2.Static Variable : means we can declare the variable outside the method.
We can use static keyword to ceclare and initialize the variavle;
Ex: Class Person{
   static String  name;
   static int age;
}


10.List 15 java keywords
public, super, import,long, char,double,length,int,extends,boolean,foalt,long,short,byte

12.What is data type and Expalin it's types

Data type is a representative of variable in the memory.
Types
1. Primitive data type
2. Non primitive datatype

1.primitive datatype : 
    primitive datatype are predefined datatypes. 8 primitive datatype are there in the java

 Primitive datatypes are :
int, double, boolean,char,long,short,foalt,byte

2.Non primitive datatypes : they are user defined datatypes
They start with uppercase
Ex : Array, String,ClassName ...


13.What is Dot operator?
using dot operator we can invoke the method

14.List of Java features?
1.Object oriented programming languafe
2.Secured
3.Platform independent

15.What is the base class of all the classes?
 Object class


16.Method overloading :
method overloading means having a same name of class name but different in length and parameters

Ex :
Class Addition{

  int a;
  int b;
  int c;

public void addition(int a, int b){
   returns a+b;
}
public void addition(int a, int b, int c){
  Sysyem.out.println("Addition of three numbers");

return a+b+c;
}

}
